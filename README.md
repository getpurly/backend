A sophicated rule engine for requisition approvals:

- Build approval chains using individual or group approvers
- Set minimum and maximum requisition amounts
- Create header and line level rules
- Both header and line rules support AND/OR operators
    - For example, header rule #1 AND header rule #2 must be true to trigger
- Line rules also support ANY/ALL match modes
    - For example, line rule #1 must match on ALL lines to trigger
- String lookups leverage exact, contains, starts with, ends with, custom regex, and is null (and their case insentive counterparts)
- Number lookups leverage equal, not equal, greater than, greater than, or equal, less than, and less than, or equal
- All fields supported on requisitions, as well as related records (e.g., user and project fields)
    - For example, construct header rule to match against owner first name or project name
- And finally, safe guards in-place to prevent requisition submission if no approval chains defined or existing ones do not contain matching rules

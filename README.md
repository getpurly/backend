# backend

Source code for purly backend.

Dependancies:

- Django 5.2, Django Rest Framework 3.16, and Python 3.13
- API filtering with django-filter
- Autogenerated API documentation with drf-spectacular
- User authentication with django-allauth


## Features

A rule engine for creating approval chains/requisition approvals:

- Use individual or group approvers
- Set minimum and maximum amounts for when to trigger
- Create header and line rules
- Leverage AND/OR operators for both header and line rules
    - For example, header rule #1 AND header rule #2 must be true to trigger
- Line rules support ANY/ALL operators
    - For example, line rule #1 must match on ALL lines to trigger
- You can also set cross logic for header and line rules
    - For example, header rule #1 OR line rule #1 must be true to trigger
- String lookups include exact, contains, starts with, ends with, custom regex, and is null (and their case insentive counterparts)
- Number lookups include equal, not equal, greater than, greater than, or equal, less than, and less than, or equal
- All fields supported on requisitions, as well as related records (e.g., user and project fields)
- And finally, safe guards in-place to prevent requisition submission if no approval chains defined or existing ones do not contain matching rules
